Steps to get started: 

1) The directory ....\Getting_Started (i.e. where this readme file is in) is an example of a "parent" directory as it contains other 
   folders used in data processing.

2) Place the input images (testing and training) in the 0-Original folder
   (Either use sample images and values in the Sample_Simulations folder or generate your own data or use experimental data)

3) If a specific set of images needs to be tested, label them starting with a z so that they are at the bottom

4) In the future, when creating files, ensure that the reference_img.png is in the parent directory

That's all, go to 2-Data processing and use a0-compiler.py and begin data processing and follow steps from there
